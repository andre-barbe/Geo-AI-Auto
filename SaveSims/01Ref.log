  ------- MODEL REPORT ------
  The un-condensed model contains:
      243 variables comprising 44137 components
  and 210 equation blocks comprising 33464 separate equations.
 
      58 variables (comprising 24210 components) will be backsolved for.
      0 variables (comprising 0 components) were substituted out.
      0 variables (comprising 0 components) were omitted.
 
  So the condensed model contains:
      185 variables comprising 19927 components

       reallocated 1 times. This may have
     slowed down this run considerably.

     statement of the form "start with mmnz = <value> ;"
       in your Command file.
