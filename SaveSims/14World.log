  ------- MODEL REPORT ------
  The un-condensed model contains:
      243 variables comprising 44137 components
  and 210 equation blocks comprising 33464 separate equations.
 
      58 variables (comprising 24210 components) will be backsolved for.
      0 variables (comprising 0 components) were substituted out.
      0 variables (comprising 0 components) were omitted.
 
  So the condensed model contains:
      185 variables comprising 19927 components
  and 152 equation blocks comprising 9254 separate equations.
